    	  <h2>Why you need this book</h2>

      <h2>Who Wrote This Book?</h2>
      <p>Hi, my name is Sheryl Ward. I run a Melbourne-based business writing consultancy which runs a wide variety of professional writing related training programs for government and business clients.</p>
      <p>One of the my most popular programs for the last 10 years has been the <a href="http://www.trainingworks.com.au/case-notes-for-health-professi/" title="Case Notes for Health Professionals - Business and Government Writing Workshops">Case Notes program</a> I run as a workshop. Given everything I've ben able to help others achieve in their work, I've taken everything that I've learnt from that work and produced this book as a useful reference and development guide for those who write case notes on a regular basis.</p>
